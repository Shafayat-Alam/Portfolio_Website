                    If that isn't weird enough for you, I love engineering! Everyone should love engineering. You find a problem, which should be easy because there TONS in the world, and then create something to solve the problem. There is something about creating...I am not sure why but I love making things. 
                    It all started many many years in a galaxy far far away, mini me was designing-drawing I should say-batman gagdets. I was at a really old age of 8, I am not sure why none of the gadgets I designed never worked. It all seemed so simple. Nevertheless, I marched on. Now the things I design and create actually work...sometimes. 
                    Surf through the projects page of projects I did for fun myself by teaching myself the skills and then trying to make what I wanted to make. Also, checkout some cool STEM projects I did in school through the robotics club and BNL SPARK Program(a student research oppurtunity program by Brookhaven National Lab).
